One thing that I wasn't expecting "now" before turn 23 years old was a recruiter of one of the biggest companies in the planet called Facebook email me
interested on my Skills..

We changed some emails and we scheduled a phone call..the phone was as most of the phone interviews are. quite general questions about life and work..
He also asked me some "simple" technical questions and them asked me if I was interested to go to the next process..

What do you think I said??! <br>
I see myself as a "child" always learning and I have been doing it as much as I can (specially in the last three months) without forget I have a life to live and to have fun..but this is what I really like to do so at least five days of seven days
of the week I'm studying/reading, coding experiments and trying to colaborate with open source projects..I have goals and I'm accomplishing step by step.

No doubt I'm going to accomplish my next goals..but I follow some engineers from Facebook and I have a friend which works for them..
they are great references as professionals and I'm not at their level "yet"..So I told him all that but I was totally willing to take the challenge. who doesn't love challenges?!

One thing that he told me was the company Facebook knows that people can learn and become great in a few months or a year..and they are always open to re-open oportunities.

"Before get the challenge I did some research about the process..and was said that the second test is the hardest one..and they have been
applying the same test for more than three years"

I spoke with my friend that works for them which gave me some very good suggestions "Test your code, then test it again and then test again"..

Oh I forgot to tell that as always work was very busy and I had to do some more work when I get home from work and my birthday would be in two days.. what hell?! excuses? this is not how my personality works. <br>
so I worked more than 12hs on my birthday to get my stuff tested and done (at my actual job)..

On sunday I started the challenge and looked like was pretty simple..haha but no. It's not simple at all (heavely focus on logic and some algorithms) so it's a great way to hire awesome engineers.
I spent "eight hours" working on the challenge and I was going well until I started to test my code and find bugs..I wanted it perfect!

Monday after work I tried fix again those bugs but I couldn't figure out how..anyway after look what was (5am) trying to make it perfect I took a shower..
And thought about it. I'm glad he got interested on my skills but I need to be realistic, I'm pretty sure I'm going to get in the next level (as we say world class) soon but not now..

I sent an email thanking him for the opportunity and telling about it. I will finish the challenge but I feel like I'm not at Facebook engineers level "yet".

All this made me even more excited about my future and my goals.. so I'm predicting (planning) a very good and quick growth in my skills in the next months..
