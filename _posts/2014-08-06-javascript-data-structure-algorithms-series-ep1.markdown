### Ep.1

I don't have officially a Computer Science degree.. But clearly nowadays you wont need a (fancy) degree to be successful. You just need to be passionated to what you do and always want to be better/evolve.

That being said I have been always trying to learn and evolve to be better on what I do which I love. And when I stop to think I remember that three years ago everything started and so many things was learned and as well so many things was forgotten to give focus to new knowledge.

Web applications has evolved to a much complex system and with that Developers/Engineers are being "forced" to solve problems (could be the other way around) applying concepts of pure Computer Science which before you would just see on systems/programs using languages as such C, C++, Java and so on.

What I want to do here it's not just help me learn more about it but also share the basics of Data Structures and Algorithms exploring some concepts with Javascript where what kind of Data Structure is more efficient than other or when certain Algorithm perform better than others.

I'm not a Computer Scientist and this Series of posts wont be very advanced but I'm sure it will be worth it.

Cheers!
