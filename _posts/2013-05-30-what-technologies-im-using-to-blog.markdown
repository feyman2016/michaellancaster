I agree it is a great CMS/Blog Tool that helps us delivery great products in short time for your client therefore it's good for business but Wordpress "themes" has a bunch of ugly, messy code and sometimes happens to be infected by other plugins/scripts causing headaches or even worst you loose your data.

## Here's why I choose Jekyll

<p>I started looking for something more elegant that I could use git _I love git_ to deploy.
So I tried Github Pages and Jekyll a _blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby_ that uses Liquid template to process the templates.
But I would do some experiments with Node.js and Ruby someday so I found <a href="http://www.heroku.com" title="Heroku" target="_blank">Heroku</a></p>

## Long story short

**In the Back-End**
- Heroku Server (AWESOME cloud application plataform).
- Ruby (Jekyll, liquid template).
- Git to deploy to my Heroku Cloud.

**In the Front-End**
- HTML5 (Markup).
- CSS3 (SASS/COMPASS) Modular Development Based.
- Responsive Design.
- JS (jQuery).
- Markdown (Blogging).
- Disqus (comments).

And that's it.
