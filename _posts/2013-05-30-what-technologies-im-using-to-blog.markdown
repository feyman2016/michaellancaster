I agree it is a great CMS/Blog Tool that helps us delivery great products in short time for your client therefore it's good for business but Wordpress "themes" has a bunch of ugly, messy code and sometimes happens to be infected by other plugins/scripts causing headaches or even worst you loose your data.

## Here's why I choose Jekyll

I started looking for something more elegant that I could use git to deploy.
So I tried Github Pages and Jekyll a _blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby_ that uses Liquid template to process the templates

<pre>
	<code data-language="css">
		.element {
			display: inline block;
		}
	</code>
</pre>

and I found Jekyll to blog I started to but I wasn't very happy because I want to test my others experiments like Node.js.
