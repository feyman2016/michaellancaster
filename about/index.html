			<strong class="ui-strong">Professional "the beginning":</strong>
			While I was in High school I decided go to technical school for Computer Science classes So I did it I was in High School in the morning and Technical Computer Science School in the nights during 2 years.
			<br>
			I could learn since Networks, Hardware, Software Development (Clipper, VB6, Delphi7), Database (SQL), going to Web Development (ASP, HTML, CSS, JS), Design Principles, Marketing and Administration.
			I still have in my External HD a Educational Math Game, A Quiz Hacker (read personal section to understand), A Library management all made with VB6 I also won the Web Development Contest Developing a Student Management Web System using HTML, CSS, jQuery, ASP and SQL.
			<br>
			I had an routine to get a book and read at least something referent to the next class I would have to discuss with the professor or ask questions.
			The only class I didn't like/enjoyed like the others was "Hardware" I do enjoyed the Networks classes but my favorite was Web Development to be honest I was always ahead of others and somethings helping the professor to explain/show something.
			we didn't have classes at Fridays but in some days I was there helping/teaching others classmate using the projector looking at my code in big screen size (Good times).

			<strong class="ui-strong">Personal</strong>
			I had my first computer at 13 year old, Late I know but I'm very curious to learn new things and see how it works so after a while almost always destroying the computer jumping site-to-site to read articles about hardware, software and download all kind of stuff (wasn't fun for my mom that had to use the same desktop).
			<br>
			After maybe 2 years I got interest to know how hackers (crakers, black hat.. whatever you call) do what they do so I started to read articles about Information Security and Hackers stuff to understand how and what they do to learn how to protect myself or become a IS guy.
			<br>
			Between the books about IS I had (have in Brazil) I bought a book called Hacker University where came with around 5 cds with exploits tools, IP/Ports Scanners, Back doors, spywares, etc..to use as a learning aspect.
			I had a very good friend
