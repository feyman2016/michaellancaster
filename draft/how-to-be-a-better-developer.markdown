### How to become better developer

Or why you should comment your code... I have been writing code for quite a while now and one of the most important things I learned from reading and writing code is to work on understanding the code around the code, does that makes sense? if not let me explain.

As a developers we tend to think just about code, lines of code, get things done and so on, but days or even hours later we can hate what we have written in the past, don't write code today.
